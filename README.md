# Tetris 2D
#### author: Andy Vine 1407626

This is my project for a Tetris 2D clone made entirely in WebGL
This is V1.0 as part of my GFX assigment Lab1a, I will work on it until it is a fully functional Tetris clone though.

[Try it out using this link](http://wwwlab.cs.univie.ac.at/~weinbachea88/Tetris/)

### Instructions:
Move the blocks with ArrowKeys or WASD,
Rotate them with Q and E or 1 and 3.
Place a Tetromino with x or press the button.

The size of the Tetrominos can be adjusted with the Unitsize input field and the coresponding variable is called *unit*
Movement speed can be altered in the Tetris.js script with the variable *moveSpeed*.

Rotation speed can be altered in the Tetris.js script with the variable *rotSpeed*. 

Extra credit tasks:
  * I used a background image wich is hosted on my Univie webspace so you don't need a keep a Http server running.
  * I added multiple other shapes like T,O,J,Z,L,I
